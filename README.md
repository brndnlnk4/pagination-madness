# pagination-madness
5 expresso shots of coffee and 4+ hours of brainstorming = self-rendered pagination script

I actually created my paginationn script while writing my 'bsExposed' application.

Ironically, I found that the pagination script that uses page numberes as navigation links was sooooo much easier to write and understand.
